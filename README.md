# Programming Exercise

I was told this should only take about 30 minutes, so this is a quick solution to the problem presented. Could definitely expand on this and make it a little more ready for a production environment, or to work with a different structure of values.

This is also making a few assumptions, such as assuming rewards points are only for whole, complete dollars, and not rounding up.

I outputted the results of the rewards calculations and totals in just basic HTML elements. I didn't apply any styling as the instructions did not even say to output the data necessarily, I could spruce it up a bit if you liked though.

Thanks for taking the time to review this.
